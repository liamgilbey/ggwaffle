Create waffle charts in R in a ggplot2-friendly way.

##  Acknowledgements

Really all credit to [Bob Rudis](https://github.com/hrbrmstr) for the work done on the original [waffle package](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/waffle). 

## Description

ggwaffle is designed to work in a very similar way to the original [waffle package](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/waffle), while being slightly closer to the workflow of a standard ggplot graphic. Consequently, it is a little more verbose.

## Installation

Currently only available through github: 

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("liamgilbey/ggwaffle")
```

## Usage

ggwaffle heavily relies on the usage of [ggplot2](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2). Much like standard ggplot graphs, waffle charts are created by adding layers to a base graphic.
Because of the inner mechanisms of ggplot2, some of the necessary data transformations have to be completed outside of a standard plot creation. The function `waffle_iron` has been added to help with issue.

ggwaffle also introduces a column mapping function, `aes_d`. At this stage I have no idea of how useful this is outside the context of the package, but it seemed a nice way to specify dynamic column renaming.
`aes_d` is obviously coined from ggplot's `aes` function and has a very similar idea. Here we are mapping column names to feed into a function so they can be renamed for used appropriately.

```{r}
library(ggwaffle)
waffle_data <- waffle_iron(mpg, aes_d(group = class))

ggplot(waffle_data, aes(x, y, fill = group)) + 
  geom_waffle()
```


Functions have also been included to make the default graphics more waffle-like.
``theme_waffle`` is a ggplot theme that strips back a lot of the elements of the waffle to create a cleaner look. ``scale_fill_waffle`` returns a discrete scale to make your charts look a lot like waffles.
Using ``coord_equal`` is recommended to make the size of the blocks even in all dimensions.

```{r, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
iris$Species <- as.character(iris$Species)
waffle_data <- waffle_iron(iris, aes_d(group = Species))

ggplot(waffle_data, aes(x, y, fill = group)) + 
  geom_waffle() + 
  coord_equal() + 
  scale_fill_waffle() + 
  theme_waffle()
```


# Icons

The best way to implement icons into waffle charts is to use Guangchuang YU's [emojifont](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/emojifont/vignettes/emojifont.html) package. 

```{r, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
library(emojifont)  

waffle_data <- waffle_iron(iris, aes_d(group = Species)) 
waffle_data$label = fontawesome('fa-twitter')

ggplot(waffle_data, aes(x, y, colour = group)) + 
  geom_text(aes(label=label), family='fontawesome-webfont', size=12) +
  coord_equal() + 
  scale_colour_waffle() + 
  theme_waffle()  
```
